## Introducing the Team
**Tool Lead:** Joshua
**Engine Lead:** Elijah 
**Design Lead:** Brody

## Tools and materials
### Engine:
For our engine, we plan to use the Baseline web browser. We decided to use this platform since our team is unfamiliar with other engines/platforms to develop games without integrated 3D graphics and all of our established skills in javaScript already. 
### Language
For the language, we will be using JavaScript 
CSS & HTML for testing and possibly UI elements

### Tools: 
enable3D is a tool for Phaser that utilizes three.js & ammo.js, written in TypeScript. It allows for the use of 3D objects and physics in the Phaser engine.
three.js is a 3D library for JavaScript. Needed as a dependency for enable3D.
ammo.js handles projectiles & collisions. Needed as a dependency for enable3D.

### Generative AI: 
Allowed uses: GitHub Copilot (in moderation). 
Grey Area: Using it to help write specific functions or help spot code smells. Using it to suggest project overview and step-by-step planning.
Restricted uses: Generative art or assets. Designing core game mechanics and level design. Using it for writing large blocks of code.
AI can be used as an assistant to better our workflow but cannot be used to overly design, code, and structure our game.
